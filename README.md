Follow, unfollow, recommendation

It is juggling but fruitfull results

I feel more confinent
using grapQL, tailwind, Nextjs, Prisma, Next js, SSG, S3 bucket, Redis, Potgres and EC2:



Differents tools, library, reacto , better code
Schema design:

A bit complex: Recommendation feature, follow and unfollow feature but fruitfull
 How to write complex query in grapjhql.
=======================
GraphQL:

Typedefs: Schema Define
query: getQury
mutations->Values add or create
resolvers:


What my observation, 
As production ready, Industry standard coding standard

How to better code
I love this type of course, content


Kudos Piyush, Wait for more this type of full fledge coursse to related industry standinng
Directly work production ready web applications.

 not like course

Use redis for cachig, rate limiting, Recommedation and 
Set up redis and Rate limiting and  caching



==================Deployment====
EC2 Instance
Elastic IP

Install Node js

Process Management Tool(PM2)
 PM2 is a Production Process Manager for Node.js applications
                     with a built-in Load Balancer.


SSL Certificate:
Create Target Group
Create load balancer
create cache-policy


============Clean all==
- Cloud front
- Load balacer
- Target groupd
- Elatic IP
- Security Group
- S3

==============Production deployent===
pm2 status
pm2 restart build/index
